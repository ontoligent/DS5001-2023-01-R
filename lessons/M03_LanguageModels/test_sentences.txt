the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend 
Mr Weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners
ChatGPT is not the singularity
but it was a black morning's work for her 
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day 
She recalled her past kindness the kindness the affection of sixteen years 
how she had taught and how she had played with her from five years old 
how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health 
and how nursed her through the various illnesses of childhood 
A large debt of gratitude was owing here 
but the intercourse of the last seven years 
the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage 
on their being left to each other was yet a dearer tenderer recollection 
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed
knowing all the ways of the family 
interested in all its concerns 
and peculiarly interested in herself in every pleasure every scheme of hers 
one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose 
and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault 
How was she to bear the change 
It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them 
but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs Weston 
only half a mile from them 
and a Miss Taylor in the house 
and with all her advantages natural and domestic 
she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude 
She dearly loved her father 
but he was no companion for her 
He could not meet her in conversation rational or playful 
The evil of the actual disparity in their ages
and Mr Woodhouse had not married early
was much increased by his constitution and habits 
for having been a valetudinarian all his life 
without activity of mind or body 
he was a much older man in ways than in years 
and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable temper 
his talents could not have recommended him at any time 
Her sister though comparatively but little removed by matrimony 
being settled in London only sixteen miles off was much beyond her daily reach 
and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield 
before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband 
and their little children to fill the house and give her pleasant society again
